# WALL3E
Arduino robot firmware projects and exploration. 
The main project codebase is the WALL3E Arduino project and is an extremely basic codebase for obstacle detection using three sonar range finders. 

The current configuration is:
- (1) Three wire PING))) sonar module
- (2) Four wire HC-SR04 sonar modules (on the left and right)
- (1) OSEPP Motor Control Board
- (4) DC motors

## Scratch Directory
The Scratch Directory contains small snippets of code used to test various parts of development. Code from projects in there may or may not be in the main project code, but it applied to something that was being explored, such as NRF2401 wireless communication, Joystick remote control, etc.
